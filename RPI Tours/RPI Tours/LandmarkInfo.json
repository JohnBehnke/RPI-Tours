Renovations to the Houston Field House were also made.\n\nThe ECAV facility has achieved LEED gold status certification. Energy-efficient features include skylights and other design components that maximize the use of natural light. The innovative design for the stadium employs a solar shading screen to control glare and heat from the western sun exposure. The inspiration for the screen design is a DNA genetic bar code.\n\nAdditional construction details to note include the arena roof, which is designed to support photovoltaic arrays totaling 14,000 square feet for future electric generation; and the stadium, which can support up to 20 micro wind turbines along its cornice.\nAlso, natural ventilation reduces reliance on heating and cooling systems. Because planting and other landscaping elements were chosen for their water conservation properties, the facility does not include an irrigation system — a decision that is expected to reduce water consumption by 50 percent.\n\nOf special note, the project was constructed using 1,767 tons of structural steel, and all wood used for the project was specified as coming from sustainable sources (Forest Steward Council certified). Within ECAV, visitors rise 30 feet to the Concourse level from Georgian Terrace on a pedestrian ramp and stairs without the use of elevators. The pedestrian ramp rises at a 5 percent grade for 333 feet and is suspended from the building on 27 2-inch solid steel rods.\n\nPhase 2 will feature an indoor pool, outdoor tennis courts, and an indoor sports facility complete with a track and tennis courts. The time frame for Phase 2 is still being developed."

The two-story structure, built by Harrison and Mero of Troy, was placed between Linac and Tibbits Avenue . The building provided facilities for utilizing the linear accelerator and allowed for expanded graduate research in neutron and radiation studies.\n\nFederal funding for the Atomic Energy Commission's research was reduced beginning in 1972. In order to save the linear accelerator program, Rensselaer purchased Linac in July 1974. In 1975, Linac was named the Gaerttner Linear Accelerator in memory of Dr. Erwin R. Gaerttner, the first director of Linac and the first chair of the Department of Nuclear Science. The American Nuclear Society designated Linac as a Nuclear Historic Landmark in 1998.

It was completed in 1907 on the former site of Rensselaer's Main Building, just West of 8th Street overlooking the city and the Hudson River.\n\nThe staircase was constructed by the City of Troy to emphasize the interdependence of this industrial city and the polytechnic school for which it is known. After devastating fires ravaged Rensselaer's Winslow Chemical Laboratory and destroyed the Main Building in 1904, trustees and administrators considered a variety of rebuilding alternatives, including a proposal to merge with the Columbia University School of Mines in New York City. Institute officials decided to stay in Troy, but to move further East up the hill. The city responded by spending $40,000 to extend Broadway to the new campus in the form of a grand staircase.\n\nFor many years the Approach remained an important link between the city and the college. Class pictures were often taken on its steps, and students regularly traversed it on their way to the railway station, off-campus rooming houses, and even the gymnasium (which was located at the bottom of the Approach).\n\nAs the campus expanded further East and the city's fortunes gradually declined, the once elegant structure fell into disrepair. By the 1970s the Approach was closed due to its precarious condition. Several attempts to refurbish it failed.\n\nIn 1994 the Approach was given a new lease on life when the Louis and Hortense Rubin Foundation launched the \"Approach and Beyond campaign\" with a $100,000 gift. The campaign raised most of the $850,000 needed to rebuild the staircase and to re-connect RPI with downtown Troy. After extensive renovation and landscaping, the Approach was officially reopened at a celebration on October 14, 1999."

The building, made of Harvard brick and Indiana limestone, was designed by W. G. Wilkins, a Pittsburgh alumnus, who donated his services. The structure was formally presented and dedicated on Alumni Day, June 13, 1911 though it was not completed until February, 1912.\n\n<i>The main entrance is on the third floor, since the building is situated on a hillside. The two lower floors contain a bookstack room, rooms for sending out catalogues, for exhibitions of drawings, for storage and janitors' quarters. The main floor contains a bookstack room, the reading room, the meeting room for the Trustees and Faculty, and the offices of the President, Treasurer and Registrar. The fourth floor is devoted to the Department of Geology, containing a large museum of geological and mineralogical specimens, and the lecture room and office of the Professor of Geology. One large hall, 100 feet by 64 feet in size, on the fifth floor is used for general meetings and social purposes.\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute Bulletin. vol.11, no. 3, September, 1912, p.11.</i>\n\nThe Pittsburgh Building continued to be used as the main administration building until it underwent a $7.5 million renovation in 1998 to become the home of the Lally School of Management and Technology. The renovation, made possible by a $15 million gift from Thelma P. and Kenneth T. Lally and by additional support from Rensselaer alumni, transformed one of Rensselaer's oldest buildings into a technology-intensive center for teaching and research. The project was completed by Lee Harris Pomeroy (Class of 1954) Associates."

Dramatic Club was held Tuesday, Nov. 25, 1929 in the Proudfit Building.” And thus a club was born.\n\nThe meeting minutes dated March 12, 1930 also contain a significant turning point in the club’s history: “The question of a name for the club was brought up and a motion was passed to call it hereafter The R.P.I. Players.” These records exists today, as excerpted from the handwritten meeting minutes of the club.\n\nThe current Playhouse, a former U.S.O. building, was moved from Windsor Locks, Connecticut to Rensselaer in 1946. The building was acquired by the Institute to accommodate a library extension, study space and social activities. The structure was placed along 15th St. and thus dubbed the 15th Street Lounge or Lounge 15. In 1972, the lounge became the RPI Playhouse. The building underwent a major renovation in 1983.\n\nIn November 1983, the newly renovated RPI Playhouse opened with a production of West Side Story. Some additional spaces, like the costume shop and set shop, were added to the building during the renovation."

In the mid-1970s the Seminary’s main structure was razed and the Folsom Library replaced it on the same site.\n\nWhen the library was completed in 1976, a plan was initiated to build a new computing center to replace the chapel. Due to interest by the faculty and students in its unique architecture, the building was instead renovated in 1979.\n\nThe VCC was named the Alan M. Voorhees Computing Center in honor of a 1947 alumnus who was a major donor to the renovation project."

It is named in honor of the 5th President of RPI, John F. Winslow, who donated half of the construction cost. The whole building was fitted for complete courses in general and analytical chemistry.\n\nThe laboratory was damaged by a fire in the upper story in 1884 and was rebuilt and enlarged in 1885. The building was again damaged by fire in 1904. It was used as a laboratory until 1907 and then converted into a shop. The building, falling into disrepair, was boarded up in the early 1970s and targeted for demolition. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 4, 1990. As an effort to save the building, it was agreed with the city of Troy that the building would be leased to house a new children's science museum called the Junior Museum. The Junior Museum refurbished the Winslow building and opened its doors in 2000. Since then, the Junior Museum has moved to the Rensselaer Technology Park, and currently the Winslow Building is home to many research groups affiliated to Cognitive Science and Computer science departments of Rensselaer, namely, Rensselaer AI and Reasoning Lab, the Social and Behavioral Research Laboratory, the Tetherless World Constellation (since 2007) etc."
