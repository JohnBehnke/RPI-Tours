The project involves two phases. The grand opening signified the end of Phase 1, which includes a multipurpose lighted stadium with field turf and seating for 5,200 and a 1,200 seat basketball arena.\n Also, a fully equipped 4,800 square foot strength and conditioning center connects to a professional-caliber sports medicine suite, and within the arena are offices for athletics administrators and coaches, numerous meeting spaces, a new Athletics Hall of Fame, a pro shop and a café. Renovations to the Houston Field House were also made.\n The ECAV facility has achieved LEED gold status certification. Energy-efficient features include skylights and other design components that maximize the use of natural light. The innovative design for the stadium employs a solar shading screen to control glare and heat from the western sun exposure. The inspiration for the screen design is a DNA genetic bar code.\n Additional construction details to note include the arena roof, which is designed to support photovoltaic arrays totaling 14,000 square feet for future electric generation; and the stadium, which can support up to 20 micro wind turbines along its cornice.\n Also, natural ventilation reduces reliance on heating and cooling systems. Because planting and other landscaping elements were chosen for their water conservation properties, the facility does not include an irrigation system — a decision that is expected to reduce water consumption by 50 percent.\n Of special note, the project was constructed using 1,767 tons of structural steel, and all wood used for the project was specified as coming from sustainable sources (Forest Steward Council certified). Within ECAV, visitors rise 30 feet to the Concourse level from Georgian Terrace on a pedestrian ramp and stairs without the use of elevators. The pedestrian ramp rises at a 5 percent grade for 333 feet and is suspended from the building on 27 2-inch solid steel rods.\n Phase 2 will feature an indoor pool, outdoor tennis courts, and an indoor sports facility complete with a track and tennis courts. The time frame for Phase 2 is still being developed."

Swanson Multidisciplinary Design Laboratory (MDL) provides undergraduate students from multiple engineering disciplines, management, humanities, architecture, and science with a facility and the resources to work together on challenging “real-world” problems.\n Through the generosity of Haas Corporation, the largest machine tool builder in the United States, and Allendale Machinery Systems, the JEC Fabrication & Prototyping Area is an official Haas Technical Education Center (HTEC). The HTEC offers students opportunities to work with some of the latest equipment in the industry, which is updated every two years to ensure that the machines are state-of-the-art."

The 217,000-square-foot facility is designed for the highest quality in acoustics, visual presentation, production, and performance technology found nowhere else under one roof.\n Led by director Johannes Goebel, the venue inspires experimentation, cross-disciplinary inquiry, and advanced research. In fact, the construction of this extraordinary building has already inspired research that may impact the planning and design of performance venues around the world."

When researchers need material not held in Rensselaer’s collection, they can initiate online interlibrary loan requests or use the Connect NY service to borrow books directly, and receive rapid delivery, from a state-wide consortia providing over 5,000,000 titles.\n Library services include an electronic class reserves system, photocopy facilities, borrowing privileges at most academic libraries in the area, individual consulting on research projects, and group study rooms. The first floor of the library houses the Center for Communication Practices.\n Students may take a break in the Library Café or borrow the latest best-seller from the Class of 1996 Reading Room — or a feature film DVD from the collection in the North Lounge."

Dramatic Club was held Tuesday, Nov. 25, 1929 in the Proudfit Building.” And thus a club was born.\n The meeting minutes dated March 12, 1930 also contain a significant turning point in the club’s history: “The question of a name for the club was brought up and a motion was passed to call it hereafter The R.P.I. Players.” These records exists today, as excerpted from the handwritten meeting minutes of the club.\n The current Playhouse, a former U.S.O. building, was moved from Windsor Locks, Connecticut to Rensselaer in 1946. The building was acquired by the Institute to accommodate a library extension, study space and social activities. The structure was placed along 15th St. and thus dubbed the 15th Street Lounge or Lounge 15. In 1972, the lounge became the RPI Playhouse. The building underwent a major renovation in 1983.\n In November 1983, the newly renovated RPI Playhouse opened with a production of West Side Story. Some additional spaces, like the costume shop and set shop, were added to the building during the renovation."

In the mid-1970s the Seminary’s main structure was razed and the Folsom Library replaced it on the same site.\n When the library was completed in 1976, a plan was initiated to build a new computing center to replace the chapel. Due to interest by the faculty and students in its unique architecture, the building was instead renovated in 1979.\n The VCC was named the Alan M. Voorhees Computing Center in honor of a 1947 alumnus who was a major donor to the renovation project."
